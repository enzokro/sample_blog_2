It also goes beyond tools like [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) that instead parse comments and docstrings into  documentation. \n",

    "Code, tests, and documentation are all first-class citizens in Literate Programming. In `nbdev` a Notebook is the single, unified source for all three things. Instead of having to independently manage code, docs, and tests, everything happens in the Notebook. If the Notebook runs then you know your code will run. The tight integration between what you're doing (code), describing what you're doing (documentation), and making sure it's correct (tests) is a great approach for both research and thinking in general.

And if anything breaks, we can always restart the Notebook and try again!  \n",
